Rina is Miyu and Hina's shy sister, with a short chestnut-brown bob, a small lavender hair clip, rose-violet eyes, warm blush, and a lavender-and-ivory sailor-style outfit. She is packaged as a Codex sprite v2 pet with nine standard animation states and sixteen clockwise look directions.

리나는 미유와 히나의 자매로, 밤색 단발머리와 작은 라벤더 머리핀, 장밋빛 보라색 눈, 붉어진 볼, 라벤더·아이보리 세라복, 두 손을 모은 수줍은 몸짓이 특징입니다. Codex sprite v2 규격의 아홉 가지 기본 애니메이션과 열여섯 방향 시선을 지원합니다.
